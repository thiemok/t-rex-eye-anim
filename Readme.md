# T-Rex Eye Lighting

This is a small project to create and animate lit eyes for a t-rex statue.
The eyes will be lit red and blink slowly in random intervals.

## Hardware

This project has very simple hardware requirements.
It is based on a d1_mini esp8266 board and 4 neopixel style leds per eye.
It can be powered via usb or 3x AA batteries.

## Build

You need [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
Once that is installed you can build and upload the project by just running `pio run`.
