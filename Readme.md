# T-Rex Eye Lighting

This is a small project to create and animate lit eyes for a t-rex statue.
The eyes will be lit red and blink slowly in random intervals.

## Hardware

It is based on a digispark attiny85 board and 4 neopixel style leds per eye.
It can be powered via usb batteries.

You need [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
Once that is installed you can build and upload the project by just running `pio run`.
